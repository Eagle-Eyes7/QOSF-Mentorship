# Task 1 : 
```You have two integers, either positive or negative, and the challenge is to generate a quantum algorithm that returns which is the larger number. Consider an appropriate number of qubits and explain why your proposal is valid for all kinds of numbers in case ```

# Explanation: Why is this code valid for all kinds of numbers:
``` This code caters both positive and negative integers. Hence it is valid for all kind of integers. We have separate functions to cater positive and negative numbers ```
